# Breakout Game Clone

## Overview

This project is a clone of the classic 1970s arcade game **Breakout**, originally developed by Atari and famously coded by Steve Wozniak. This version is implemented using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game involves controlling a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks arranged in a wall at the top of the screen. The goal is to destroy all the bricks without letting the ball fall off the screen.
